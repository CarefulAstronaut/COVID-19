# COVID-19

Working with the Kaggle Open Dataset, I wanted to try and do my part to help with the analysis. 
 
## Kaggle Tasks

The Kaggle dataset comes with a number of tasks, listed below:

* What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=568)
* What do we know about the COVID-19 risk factors? - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=558)
